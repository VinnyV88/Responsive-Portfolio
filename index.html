				<section class="AboutMe_content">
					<p>Hello, and welcome to my page! My name is Vincent Visconti. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. Since 2001, I've lived in New Jersey.   Sayreville, NJ is where I currently live with my beautiful wife, Ana, and our handsome son, Jason, who is three years old.</p><br>

					<p>I currently work as a computer programmer for <a class="LinkContent" href="http://www.sound-recording.org" target="_blank">Sound Recording Special Payments Fund</a>, a non-profit fund that collects money from major record labels and then distributes payments to musicians annually, similar to royalties, but with a formula that benefits common musicians whose only requirement would be that they recorded music for a record company covered under our agreement.</p><br>

					<p>When I'm not working, or spending quality time with my family, I enjoy rooting for my favorite childhood sports teams. Well, enjoy might be too nice a word to describe how I feel when I watch games. See, I'm what NY area sports fans call a JIM. A <a class="LinkContent" href="http://www.newyorkjets.com/" target="_blank">Jets</a>, <a class="LinkContent" href="https://www.nhl.com/islanders" target="_blank">Islanders</a>, and <a class="LinkContent" href="http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=nym" target="_blank">Mets</a> fan. These teams have done much to torture their fans over the years. There are (or should be) support groups for these fans. To be a fan of these teams, you would have to be incredibly passionate and loyal to them or you would have dropped them years ago. The worst thing any of these teams can do to their fans is give them hope. Because as soon as they do, they rip your heart out. My wife thinks I'm a little crazy how I let these teams affect me, and she probably has a point. But when you're passionate about something, you have to go all in.</p><br>

					<p>Same goes with anything in life. It's what brought me to where I am today, taking a web development coding bootcamp at Rutgers. After over 15 years of being a computer programmer, working mostly on legacy systems written in COBOL, I decided to modernize my skills. I've dabbled with web development in the past and was able to hack my way to maintaining my company's website using HTML, CSS, and PHP. But it's time to go all in and learn it all the right way, soup to nuts! I'm definitely looking forward to the challenge.</p>
